  "faction_description": "A politically far right neo-Nazi faction who embrace many of the ideals of World War II Nazi Germany. Their leader, the Führer, enforces a policy of oppression against all those who are considered 'inferior' which includes people who have been mutated by radiation. Their home station is the triple station of Tverskaya-Chekhovskaya-Pushkinskaya, though they occupy many other stations and bases on the surface. In a state of perpetual war with their political opposites, the Red Line, their army consists of highly trained men with advanced equipment, and often utilise Wehrmacht-style helmets and banners. They prefer well trained soldiers and heavy firepower at the expense of a smaller army (possibly because their purges have limited their recruitment options). The Nazis are always a hostile faction towards the player, as they commonly assume that Artyom is a Communist, claiming he is an 'Enemy Scout' or a 'Red Spy'."

  "faction_description": "his faction is a collection of stations that occupy the Koltsevaya Ring Line of the Metro. Formed during the early days of the Metro when Central Metro Command fell, Hansa is the most powerful faction in the Metro. Their influence stretches in all directions due to their line being impossible to bypass, meaning Hansa grew incredibly rich. Although their security forces are well equipped, they rarely seek war, preferring to use economic sanctions to suppress their neighbours. They also protect a number of satellite factions, in return for food, electricity and so on. Their leader is the mysterious Prime Minister Rusakov."

  "faction_name": "Polis",
  "faction_description": "Occupying the Arbatskaya, Alexandrovsky Sad, Biblioteka im Lenina and Borovitskaya stations, Polis is the beacon of light in the post-apocalyptic Metro. Created by previous members of the Russian government, military, and police, Polis is the factions closest to pre-war life, with electric lighting and relatively comfortable living conditions. Taking their society from Indian caste system, the Brahmin lead, the Kshatriya are the protectors, the Vashiya the merchants and the Shudra, who are the servants, Polis actively seeks to preserve as much of the old world as possible. They frequently send Stalkers to the surface to hunt for pre-war books that they distribute to the entire Metro."

  "faction_name": "Rangers of the Order",
  "faction_description": "A para-military organisation considered the protectors of the Metro, the Rangers venture the Metro and the surface, eliminating mutants and bandits who prey on the weak. Although technically neutral, they have close ties with Polis, with many members hailing from there. They have no home stations, instead occupying the surface base of Sparta, and the D6 bunker. Their leader, Miller, enforces a policy of 'if it's hostile, you kill it', which has served the Rangers well so far. Many members were previously Russian special forces or military, training which makes them ideal soldiers for protecting the Metro. This is also Artyom's faction."

  "faction_name": "Red Line",
  "faction_description": "The Red Line are a politically far-left faction who emulate the former Soviet-Union, particularly that of Stalin's era. Occupying the Sokolnicheskaya Line, minus the two stations of the Ring, the Red Line are a powerful faction. Although not as openly hostile as their enemies, the Fourth Reich, they are nonetheless an oppressive society, with many executions and imprisonments. Their army is reminiscent of the World War II Red Army, compromising of large quantities of poorly trained and equipped men with low survivability. Their huge (relative to the rest of the Metro) population allows this huge neglect for life. They have some well trained and equipped soldiers though, who are most likely either pre-war soldiers or veteran conscripts. These soldiers are rarely seen near the frontlines though. Their leader, Secretary Moskvin, is a harsh leader, though the faction is fairly wealthy nonetheless."

Unlike many other factions, they are completely neutral, even willing to deal with the likes of the Fourth Reich, buying slaves from them to work on plantations. However, they are having problems with disappearances, rumoured to have been kidnapped by Satanists."

  "faction_name": "Satanists",
  "faction_description": "A myth amongst the Metro, the Satanists are said to occupy the stations from Dubrovka to Lyublino. Driven mad by the apocalypse, the Satanists kidnap Metro dwellers and force them to dig a huge hole in Lyublino station, that they believe is the portal to Hell itself. Given that there is only one known witness of this, whether or not the Satanists truly exist is questionable."

  "faction_name": "Bandits",
  "faction_description": "Bandits is the catchall term for loosely organised gangs and thugs. Controlling certain stations throughout the Metro system, though rarely more than one, bandits are known to rob and murder defenceless travellers in the tunnels, taking their goods to sell on. However, some 'bandits' are simply lawless factions, such as those ruling Venice or Kitai-Gorod, and are not as extreme as other bandits. Although their businesses may be lucrative, and they are not afraid to kill to get what they want, they are not openly hostile. Many bandit factions are also rumoured to create and sell poor quality or fake merchandise to gullible travellers, often for the same price as a genuine copy."
