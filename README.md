Metro 2033 Companion Map
========================

So I've opened the book, on the first page(s) I see a beautiful map of the post-apocalyptic Moscow metro, then the story begins and within the first paragraphs comes up the first mentioned station, something ending with *-skaya*. It seemed like a good idea to check the map and get contextualized by location and character's anecdotes inside the main story, so meta, but looking at the map and trying to match the word in my brain (which I had to recheck so as not to forget) with one of the multiple words (aka stations names) ending with *-skaya* wasn't that fun. I've stopped and looked into the internetz for something I will later find myself doing and hoping for others to join the party and enhance this tool in all the ways imagined as long as you don't ask for ammunition.
